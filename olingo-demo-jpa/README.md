jpastandalone was created using the wizards in NetBeans 7.3.1  I created it because I see a fair number of questions
about a working example for JPA standalone.  I believe there is more than one tutorial which takes you through this process but I would be happy to document it here as well if someone is interested.

In general folks are running apps in containers and CDI so this
standalone app is not popular and perhaps frowned upon.  On the other hand if you need a standalone JPA app or are just in need of an example, this is generated code (except for the App class) and it references the sample database which comes with NetBeans.
